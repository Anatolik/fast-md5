Changes in 2.7.1:
	- Added native method support for freebsd_x86 and freebsd_amd64.
	- Greatly reduced size of DLL for win_amd64.
	- Enhanced MD5OutputStreamTest to work with the 'md5' binary when
	  the 'md5sum' binary is not found.
Changes in 2.7:
	- Added native method support for darwin_x86_64, linux_amd64 and
	  win_amd64.
	- Enhanced initNativeLibrary() to report whether native library
	  support has been successfully loaded.
	- Recover gracefully if native library is found but fails to load
	  due to an UnsatisfiedLinkError.
	- Javadoc documentation is now included with the distribution.
	- Created a new Ant build file from scratch to automate all
	  aspects of the compilation, building, testing, and packaging
	  process, including native method compilation.
	- Improved test script to report detected architecture and status
	  of native library loading.
Changes in 2.6.2:
	- Fixed stack overflow bug which occurred in native method when
	  called with a large buffer.  All users which update the hash's
	  state using large buffers are encouraged to upgrade in order to
	  guard against crashes and potential security implications.
	- Added native method support for OS X on x86 hardware.
Changes in 2.6.1:
	- Martin West contributed a bug fix and some code refactoring to
	  make all targets work out of the box in the Ant build file.
	  Previously, the "dist" target did not work if the "docs"
	  directory was not present.
Changes in 2.6:
	- Added OS X support for native method.
	- Eked a little more speed out of the native method version by
	  special-casing little endian architectures and skipping
	  operations that would be redundant on them.
	- Added the ability to access the MD5 instance held by an
	  MD5InputStream or MD5OutputStream.  The primary motivation here
	  was so that you can reset the MD5 instance mid-stream and thereby
	  checksum blocks of a stream (this was to enable more efficient
	  error correction in Magic Mirror Backup).
	- Fixed incorrect documentation describing how to bypass test for
	  native methods.
	- Added Linux Makefile to distribution.
	- Added Ant build file to distribution.
	- Restructured directories to be Ant-friendly.
	- Fixed some typos.
Changes in 2.5:
	- Added an optional native method for hash calculation for
	  additional speed improvement.
	- Cleaned up the code a little to make it friendlier to Javadoc.
Changes in 2.1:
	- Added a note to Update(String) explaining that the results of the
	  method may vary across platforms.  Thanks to Peter Speck for
	  pointing this out.
	- Added an overloaded version of the Update() method which takes
	  as parameters both a String and a character encoding for
	  converting the String to a byte array.
